# SAS-Introduction-to-Statistics---My-Notes---Foteini-Rodi
Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data.
Statistical methods are widely used in many areas, such as business and finance, medicine, science, and agriculture. In fact, we also encounter statistical information in many aspects of our personal lives; for example, you've probably read or heard many reports in the media that summarize economic data or the results of a health study by providing statistics.

This course introduces some fundamental ideas in statistics. First, you'll learn some basic statistics terminology, as well as how samples are chosen for study and analysis. This course also shows you how variables are classified based on the type of information they contain and how they are used in an analysis.

Next, you'll learn some of the most common ways to summarize different kinds of data using both numbers and pictures. You probably encounter these types of statistical summaries on a regular basis.

Numerical summary values that you might be familiar with include
•	measures of location, such as the mean and percentiles, and
•	measures of variability, such as standard deviation.


Finally, you'll learn two of the most common tools of inferential statistics
•	confidence intervals and 
•	hypothesis testing.

These tools combine statistics with mathematical probability. The results enable analysts to draw formal conclusions about what the data means and to make better decisions. Don't worry if these terms are unfamiliar. You'll know what they mean by the time you finish the course!

You might be wondering what value this course has for your work. That's a reasonable question. Let's consider a couple of situations.

Perhaps you took a college-level statistics course in the past and now plan to use SAS to perform data analysis. You've found that you need a refresher on the basics before taking advanced analytics classes.

This course will provide that refresher and prepare you for the next step in your training, which might be either Statistics 1: Introduction to ANOVA, Regression, and Logistic Regression or SAS Enterprise Guide: ANOVA, Regression, and Logistic Regression.

If you're a SAS programmer who works in a field that makes use of statistical methods, the concepts and terminology you learn in this course will enable you to communicate more effectively with statisticians and analysts. These concepts will also provide some insight into how data sets should be constructed in SAS for statistical analysis, and may enable you to perform simple data quality checks on your own. All of these skills will make you a better and more efficient SAS programmer.

Whether this course serves as the first step of your SAS analytics training or as a stand-alone introduction to statistics, we hope that you enjoy the course and find it useful for your work!
